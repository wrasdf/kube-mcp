# Kube-MCP Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First

**Every line of code MUST meet production-grade quality standards before merge.**

- Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming conventions
- Complex logic MUST include inline comments explaining the "why"
- Functions MUST have single responsibility and clear interfaces
- Code reviews MUST verify adherence to project style guides
- Static analysis tools MUST pass without warnings
- Technical debt MUST be documented and tracked explicitly

**Rationale**: Quality issues compound over time. Enforcing quality from the start prevents maintenance burden and reduces long-term costs.

### II. Test Coverage & Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**All production code MUST have accompanying tests. Tests MUST be written before implementation (TDD).**

- **Unit Tests**: MUST cover all business logic with minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: MUST verify all inter-service and external system interactions
- **Contract Tests**: MUST validate all API contracts and data formats
- **Test Isolation**: Each test MUST be independently runnable and not depend on execution order
- **Test Clarity**: Test names MUST clearly describe the scenario being tested
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Tests MUST fail initially, then pass after implementation

**Rationale**: Tests are living documentation and safety nets. TDD ensures testable design and prevents regressions while enabling confident refactoring.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**All user-facing features MUST provide a consistent, intuitive, and accessible experience.**

- **Consistency**: UI/UX patterns MUST be consistent across all interfaces (CLI, Web, API)
- **Accessibility**: Features MUST follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines where applicable
- **Error Messages**: MUST be actionable, user-friendly, and provide clear next steps
- **Response Times**: User actions MUST provide feedback within 200ms (perceived responsiveness)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features MUST degrade gracefully when dependencies fail
- **Documentation**: User-facing features MUST include usage examples and common scenarios

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves adoption, and decreases support burden. Users should never feel lost or confused.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**All features MUST meet defined performance benchmarks before production deployment.**

- **Response Time**: API endpoints MUST respond within p95 < 500ms under normal load
- **Throughput**: Systems MUST handle 1000 requests/second minimum
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage MUST remain under 512MB per service instance
- **Database Queries**: N+1 query patterns are PROHIBITED; pagination REQUIRED for large datasets
- **Profiling**: Performance-critical paths MUST be profiled and optimized
- **Monitoring**: All services MUST expose metrics (latency, throughput, error rates)
- **Load Testing**: New features MUST undergo load testing before production

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user experience and operational costs. Proactive optimization prevents emergency fixes and outages.

### V. Documentation Excellence

**Code without documentation is incomplete. Documentation MUST be maintained alongside code.**

- **API Documentation**: All public APIs MUST have OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Code Documentation**: All exported functions/classes MUST have docstrings
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) REQUIRED for significant design choices
- **Quickstart Guides**: New features MUST include quickstart documentation
- **Changelog**: All changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- **Examples**: Documentation MUST include working code examples
- **Maintenance**: Documentation updates MUST be part of every feature PR

**Rationale**: Documentation reduces onboarding time, enables self-service, and preserves institutional knowledge.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Process

- All code MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer before merge
- Reviewers MUST verify constitution compliance (quality, tests, performance, docs)
- Reviews MUST be completed within 24 hours
- "Approve with suggestions" is acceptable for minor issues with follow-up tasks
- Blocking concerns MUST be clearly articulated with specific examples

### Branch Strategy

- Feature branches MUST follow naming convention: `###-feature-name`
- Main branch MUST always be deployable
- PRs MUST be small and focused (< 400 lines preferred)
- Merge REQUIRES all CI checks passing
- Commits MUST follow Conventional Commits specification

### Technology Standards

- Language versions MUST be explicitly documented in Technical Context
- Dependencies MUST be pinned to specific versions
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed within 7 days (critical) or 30 days (high)
- Deprecated APIs MUST be migrated within one major version cycle

## Quality Gates

**All gates MUST pass before production deployment:**

### Pre-Merge Gates

- ✅ All tests passing (unit, integration, contract)
- ✅ Code coverage meets minimum threshold (80%)
- ✅ Static analysis passes without warnings
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Code review approved

### Pre-Deployment Gates

- ✅ Load testing completed
- ✅ Security scanning passed
- ✅ Monitoring/alerting configured
- ✅ Rollback plan documented
- ✅ Changelog updated

### Complexity Justification

When introducing complexity that violates simplicity principles (e.g., new abstraction layer, design pattern, framework):

- MUST document in "Complexity Tracking" section of plan.md
- MUST explain why simpler alternative insufficient
- MUST have approval from tech lead or architecture review
- MUST include migration plan if replacing existing approach

## Governance

### Constitution Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. When conflicts arise, this document takes precedence.

### Amendment Process

1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented in a PR with rationale
2. Amendments REQUIRE approval from project maintainers
3. Version number MUST be incremented according to semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible changes (principle removal/redefinition)
   - **MINOR**: New principle or section added
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes
4. Migration plan REQUIRED for breaking changes
5. All dependent templates MUST be updated in same PR

### Compliance Review

- All PRs MUST include a self-certification checklist verifying constitution compliance
- Monthly constitution compliance audits REQUIRED for active projects
- Violations MUST be addressed immediately or have documented exception with sunset date
- Repeated violations trigger architecture review and potential refactoring

### Version History

This constitution is a living document. All amendments MUST be tracked in git history and summarized in sync impact reports.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-27 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27
