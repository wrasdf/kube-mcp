# Specification Quality Checklist: EKS Cluster Log Analysis with Data Sanitization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-27

**Key Decisions**:
- Audit logging will include user identity (who + what + when) for accountability and compliance
- Audit Log Entry entity added to Key Entities section
- FR-017 updated to reflect requirement for user identity tracking

**Readiness**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- All checklist items passed validation
- One clarification was resolved during specification creation (audit log user identity)
- Specification maintains focus on WHAT users need without prescribing HOW to implement
