# Feature Specification: EKS Cluster Log Analysis with Data Sanitization

**Feature Branch**: `001-eks-log-analyzer`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an MCP server to analyze EKS cluster pod logs and events. Sanitize logs to remove personal and sensitive data (e.g., PII, secrets, tokens)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Query Pod Logs Safely (Priority: P1)

As a DevOps engineer troubleshooting production issues, I need to retrieve and analyze pod logs from an EKS cluster without exposing sensitive customer data or credentials, so that I can diagnose problems while maintaining security and compliance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling safe log analysis. Without this, the tool has no purpose. This represents the minimum viable product that immediately delivers value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by querying logs for a specific pod and verifying that: (1) logs are successfully retrieved, (2) PII like email addresses and phone numbers are redacted, (3) secrets and tokens are masked, and (4) the logs remain readable and useful for debugging.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running EKS cluster with active pods, **When** I request logs for a specific pod, **Then** the system returns sanitized logs with all PII patterns replaced with placeholder tokens
2. **Given** logs containing AWS credentials or API tokens, **When** I retrieve those logs, **Then** all credential-like strings are masked with `[REDACTED-CREDENTIAL]` while preserving log structure
3. **Given** logs with email addresses and phone numbers, **When** I query the logs, **Then** emails show as `[EMAIL-REDACTED]` and phone numbers as `[PHONE-REDACTED]`
4. **Given** no active pods in a namespace, **When** I attempt to query logs, **Then** I receive a clear message indicating no pods are available

---

### User Story 2 - Analyze Cluster Events (Priority: P2)

As a platform engineer monitoring cluster health, I need to retrieve and analyze Kubernetes events across namespaces with sensitive data removed, so that I can identify systemic issues and patterns without accessing confidential information.

**Why this priority**: Events provide crucial context for debugging and monitoring, complementing pod logs. This is the natural second layer of observability after basic log retrieval.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying events for a namespace and verifying that: (1) events are successfully retrieved with timestamps and reasons, (2) any sensitive data in event messages is sanitized, (3) events can be filtered by type or time range, and (4) the information remains actionable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** events in a specific namespace, **When** I query events for that namespace, **Then** I receive a list of sanitized events with timestamps, reasons, and affected resources
2. **Given** events containing sensitive configuration data, **When** I retrieve those events, **Then** patterns matching secrets or credentials in event messages are redacted
3. **Given** multiple namespaces in the cluster, **When** I query events without specifying a namespace, **Then** I receive sanitized events from all accessible namespaces
4. **Given** a time range filter, **When** I query events, **Then** only events within that time window are returned

---

### User Story 3 - Configure Sanitization Rules (Priority: P3)

As a security admin, I need to define custom patterns for data sanitization beyond the default rules, so that I can adapt the tool to our organization's specific compliance requirements and data sensitivity policies.

**Why this priority**: While default sanitization covers common cases, organizations have unique requirements. This enables customization but is not essential for initial value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a custom regex pattern for a proprietary identifier format, querying logs containing that pattern, and verifying the custom pattern is correctly redacted while standard patterns still work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to protect a custom identifier format, **When** I add a new sanitization pattern with a regex, **Then** subsequent log queries apply this pattern alongside default rules
2. **Given** an overly broad sanitization pattern, **When** I test it against sample logs, **Then** I receive a preview showing what would be redacted without affecting live queries
3. **Given** multiple custom patterns, **When** I manage my patterns, **Then** I can view, update, and remove custom patterns without affecting defaults
4. **Given** conflicting patterns (custom vs. default), **When** logs are sanitized, **Then** the more specific pattern takes precedence

### Edge Cases

- What happens when logs contain structured JSON with sensitive data nested deeply in the structure?
- How does the system handle extremely large log volumes (e.g., 100MB+ of logs from a single pod)?
- What if a pod is actively writing logs while they're being retrieved - are partial lines handled correctly?
- How are multi-line stack traces processed to ensure credentials in exception messages are redacted?
- What happens when cluster credentials expire or become invalid during a query?
- How does the system behave when querying logs from terminated or crashed pods?
- What if sanitization patterns accidentally remove all meaningful content from a log line?
- How are non-UTF-8 or binary log content handled without breaking the sanitization process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to an EKS cluster using provided AWS credentials and retrieve pod logs via Kubernetes API
- **FR-002**: System MUST sanitize all retrieved logs before returning them, applying pattern-based redaction for PII, secrets, and tokens
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and redact email addresses, replacing them with `[EMAIL-REDACTED]` tokens
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect and redact phone numbers in common formats (US, international), replacing them with `[PHONE-REDACTED]` tokens
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect and redact AWS credentials (access keys, secret keys, session tokens) with `[REDACTED-CREDENTIAL]` tokens
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect and redact common secret patterns including JWT tokens, API keys, OAuth tokens, and private keys with `[REDACTED-SECRET]` tokens
- **FR-007**: System MUST retrieve Kubernetes events from specified namespaces and apply the same sanitization rules as pod logs
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to query logs for a specific pod by name and namespace
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to query events for a specific namespace or across all namespaces
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve log structure and timestamps during sanitization to maintain debugging utility
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle connection errors to the EKS cluster gracefully with clear error messages
- **FR-012**: System MUST support tail-like functionality to retrieve recent logs (e.g., last 100 lines or last N minutes)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide default sanitization patterns that can be extended with custom patterns
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to add custom regex patterns for organization-specific sensitive data
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate custom regex patterns before allowing them to be used in sanitization
- **FR-016**: System MUST operate as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, exposing log and event retrieval as callable tools
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain an audit log recording who performed each query, what resources were accessed, and when the query occurred, enabling accountability and compliance auditing
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle multi-line log entries (e.g., stack traces) as single logical units during sanitization

### Key Entities

- **Pod Log Entry**: A single log line from a container in a Kubernetes pod, containing timestamp, message content, and source metadata (pod name, namespace, container name). May contain sensitive data requiring sanitization.

- **Kubernetes Event**: A cluster event record describing state changes or issues, containing event type, reason, timestamp, affected resource, and message. May contain sensitive configuration data in messages.

- **Sanitization Pattern**: A rule defining what data to redact, including pattern type (email, phone, credential, secret, custom), matching regex, replacement token, and priority. Custom patterns can be added by users.

- **Query Request**: A user request for logs or events, specifying target resource (pod name, namespace), optional filters (time range, line count), and sanitization preferences. Includes authentication context for cluster access and user identity for audit logging.

- **Audit Log Entry**: A record of a query operation, containing user identity (username or identifier), timestamp, query type (pod logs or events), target resources (pod/namespace names), and query parameters. Used for compliance and security auditing.
